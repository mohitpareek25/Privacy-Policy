### 3.3 Sharing 

By using Direct Chat, you agree to the third party use, sharing and transfer of your personal information (both inside and outside of your jurisdiction) as prescribed in this Privacy Policy.  

We will share information about you when you upload or post these information on Direct Chat, or if we notify you that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available.

We may share information about you in anonymous and/or aggregated form with third parties for usage analytics (to help us better understand who is using our services and how), and for industry analysis, demographic profiling, research, and other similar purposes.

Your information may be accessed and used by our service providers who are working with us in connection with the operation of our services.
